# BDSA Project - Group: Pixeline og Den Onde Fisk

## Starting the project

- Run the Start-App-p1 file in the terminal
- Then run the command dotnet ef database update --project Server/TrialProject.Server.csproj <br /> (*This will give thet error that "There is already an object named 'Students' in the database." We want Students to be in the database so this error can be ignored*)
- Now you can run the program with dotnet run --project Server/TrialProject.Server.csproj

We really wanted to get everything to run together as one in the Start-App file but it doesn't do the database update correctly when inserted into this file.
